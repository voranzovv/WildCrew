## Overview

### The Problem

Organizing group outdoor activities often involves fragmented communication across social media groups, messaging apps, and manual headcounts. Weather changes and location coordination add extra layers of complexity and risk.

### The Solution

**WildCrew** consolidates everything outdoor group leaders and members need into a single platform:

- **Event Management & Headcount Control:** Hosts can set strict headcount limits and review attendee requests to keep trips safe and manageable.
- **Interactive Mapping:** Trailhead markers and interactive route maps powered by Mapbox.
- **Real-Time Weather Integration:** Live weather forecasts rendered directly on event details pages for trip dates.
- **Post-Trip Community Engagement:** Member reviews, ratings, and photo sharing.
